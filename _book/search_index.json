On purpose some of these ideas are vague and/or depends on data collection, extraction and analysis that may not be easy or even possible, but these are somehow representative of the real Data Science projects you will face, since it is somehow rare that all our data is already collected and organized. 10.1 Projects based on Educational Data Obtaining some metadata from some Open Journal Systems-based journals Open Journal Systems is a free, open source solution to managing and publishing academic journals online. It is used by several journals around the world. Besides managing all the tasks related to publishing papers in digital journals, it contains the papers themselves and metadata that could be useful for some analysis. 5Q.M#wx7 There is a package in R (OJS Scraper for R) that can be used to extract data from Open Journal Systems instances. Install it, use the examples on the GitHub repo to point to one of the sites listed below and try to extract some metrics. Brazilian Journal of Development, https://ojs.brazilianjournals.com.br/ojs/index.php/BRJD Brazilian Applied Science Review, https://ojs.brazilianjournals.com.br/ojs/index.php/BASR International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, https://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE You can get more links for journals that uses OJS at Details of publications using software by the Public Knowledge Project. Some metadata that can be extracted are the authors’ names, paper title, abstract and keywords. We would like to have a data frame with all papers in all issues of a journal with the metadata, for further analysis. What else? Evaluate the process and data obtained. What higher-level information can be obtained from this project? What is interesting but not possible with the data? 10.2 Projects based on Politics Data "],["project-supermarket-basket-eda.html", "Chapter 11 Project: Supermarket Basket EDA", " Chapter 11 Project: Supermarket Basket EDA "],["cookbook-reading-and-writing.html", "Chapter 12 Cookbook: Reading and Writing", " Chapter 12 Cookbook: Reading and Writing "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "404 - Not Found", " 404 - Not Found Weird.
